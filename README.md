**Exploring Fuel Efficiency & Vehicle Performance with Python, SQL & Power BI**

This project is all about uncovering patterns in fuel efficiency and engine performance using the classic Auto MPG dataset. I took this from raw data to a clean, interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story — perfect for automotive analytics and business intelligence use cases.


Here’s what I did step by step:

- Cleaned and transformed the dataset in **Python (Pandas)** — handled nulls, fixed data types, and extracted brand names
- Used **SQL Server** to write analytical queries that revealed fuel economy patterns, brand-wise comparisons, and cylinder/origin breakdowns
- Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with KPI cards, brand analysis, year-over-year trends, and filters that make exploring the data easy and insightful


## Tools

- `Python` (for data wrangling)
- `SQL Server` (for performance queries)
- `Power BI` (for building the final interactive dashboard)
- `DAX` (for dynamic KPI calculations)


## Dashboard

- **KPI cards**: Avg MPG, Total Cars, Avg Horsepower, Avg Weight  
- **Bar chart**: Avg MPG by Brand  
- **Line chart**: MPG Trend by Model Year  
- **Clustered bar**: Cylinders by Origin  
- **Data table**: Car-wise performance metrics  


## Why I Did This

I built this project to sharpen my end-to-end data analysis skills and tell a meaningful story using real automotive data.

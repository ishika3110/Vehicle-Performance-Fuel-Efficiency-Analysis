# Auto MPG Analysis Dashboard

**Fuel Efficiency & Vehicle Performance Insights Using Python, SQL, and Power BI**

This end-to-end data analytics project dives into the Auto MPG dataset to uncover meaningful insights about vehicle fuel efficiency, engine specs, and brand performance from 1970 to 1982.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 📦 **Data Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Auto MPG Dataset  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handled nulls, removed inconsistencies, standardized brand names using Python (Pandas)  
- 🧠 **SQL Analysis**: Wrote performance-driven queries in SSMS to analyze average MPG, cylinders by origin, and trend patterns  
- 📈 **Power BI Dashboard**: Built an interactive dashboard with KPI cards, filters, and dynamic visuals for brands, model years, and fuel efficiency  
- 💡 **Key Insight**: Japanese brands consistently outperformed American manufacturers in fuel efficiency across all years

## 🛠 Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing (`pandas`, `numpy`)  
- **SQL Server** – Data analysis using complex SQL queries  
- **Power BI** – Data storytelling via interactive dashboard  
- **DAX** – Custom KPIs, aggregations, and calculated fields

## 📌 Key Visuals

- 🔍 Brand vs Average MPG (bar chart)
- 📈 MPG trend over time (line chart)
- 🏭 Cylinders by origin (clustered bar)
- 📋 Car performance table with slicers
- 💡 KPI cards for Total Cars, Avg MPG, Weight, Horsepower

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to clean real-world automotive data using Python  
- How to convert messy datasets into structured insights via SQL  
- How to build a business-ready dashboard with storytelling in mind  
- How to extract brand-level, origin-level, and temporal patterns from fuel efficiency data
